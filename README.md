# Problem Statement 1: La Liga Cup Team Analysis

You were recently hired as a business analyst in a top sports company. The senior management team has asked you to come up with metrics with which they can gauge which team will win the upcoming **La Liga Cup** (Football tournament).

The given dataset contains information on all the teams that have participated in past tournaments. It includes data such as:

- Goals scored and conceded
- Number of times a team placed within the top 6 positions
- Number of seasons qualified
- Best position achieved in the past, etc.

**Note:**  
Before starting the analysis, it's important to clean the dataset by checking for any hyphens or symbols and making appropriate replacements to ensure proper arithmetic operations.

### Objectives

Prepare a short report to answer the following:

1. Which teams started playing between **1930 and 1980**?
2. Which are the **top 5 teams in terms of total points**?
3. What is the **distribution of winning percentage** for all teams?
   - Which teams are in the **top 5 in terms of winning percentage**?  
   *(Winning percentage = (Games Won / Games Played) Ã— 100)*
4. Is there a significant difference in the **winning percentage** for:

# Problem Statement 2: Blood Pressure Study

A study was conducted to measure the **blood pressure of 60-year-old women with glaucoma**. A random sample of **200 women** was selected.

- **Mean systolic blood pressure**: 140 mm Hg  
- **Standard deviation**: 25 mm Hg

### Objectives

Prepare a short report to answer the following:

1. Calculate the **estimated standard error** of the sample mean.  
   - What does the standard error indicate?
2. Estimate a **95% confidence interval** for the true mean blood pressure of all 60-year-old women with glaucoma.
3. Assume a smaller random sample of **100 women** was chosen (mean and standard deviation remain the same).  
   - What is the **estimated 95% confidence interval** in this case?
4. **Which of the two confidence intervals is wider**?
5. **Explain in non-technical terms** what a confidence interval means and what it tells us about the population.
